These are preliminary notebooks. They are part of the [DTC-Glaciers](https://dtcglaciers.org) project, funded by the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/).

- [Glacier runoff in the Alps](notebooks/01_alps.ipynb) presents how the dtcg API can be used to access and visualise glacier runoff data in the Alps.
- [CryoSat2 - model comparison at Vatnajökull ice cap, Iceland](notebooks/02_iceland.ipynb) compares state of the art global glacier modelling products with EO data at Vatnajökull ice cap, Iceland.

This project has just started! The notebooks presented here are a first iteration of the data assimilation and visualisation pipeline and serve as a baseline from which we will build upon. Check back for updates soon, and if you are interested in contributing, please get in touch!
